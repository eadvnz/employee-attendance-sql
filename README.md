\# Employee Attendance \& Leave Management System (SQL)



\## About the Project

This project is a \*\*SQL-based database system\*\* developed to manage employee details,

daily attendance records, and leave information.



The main objective of this project is to practice \*\*core DBMS concepts\*\* such as

table design, relationships, joins, aggregation, and conditional logic using SQL.

It also generates a \*\*monthly attendance summary\*\* to evaluate employee performance.



This project was created as part of \*\*BCA internship preparation\*\*.



\## Tools and Technologies Used

\- SQL (MySQL)



\## Database Design

The database consists of \*\*three main tables\*\*.



\### Employees Table

Stores employee information such as name, department, designation, joining date,

salary, and email.



\### Attendance Table

Stores daily attendance records including attendance date, status  

(Present, Absent, Late, Half Day), and working hours.



\### Leave Details Table

Stores employee leave information including leave date, leave type,

and approval status.



A \*\*SQL VIEW\*\* is used to generate the monthly attendance summary.



\## Project Features

\- Manage employee details  

\- Record daily attendance for multiple working days  

\- Handle different attendance statuses  

\- Store approved leave records  

\- Generate monthly attendance summary  

\- Classify employee performance as \*\*Excellent\*\*, \*\*Good\*\*, or \*\*Needs Improvement\*\*



\## How to Run the Project

1\. Open \*\*MySQL Command Line\*\* or \*\*MySQL Workbench\*\*

2\. Create and use the database

3\. Run the SQL file \*\*employee\_attendance\_project.sql\*\*

4\. Execute SELECT queries or use the monthly attendance summary view



The complete database and reports can be recreated by running the SQL file.



\## Output

The project generates a \*\*monthly attendance summary\*\* that shows:

\- Total working days  

\- Number of present days  

\- Late and half-day count  

\- Average working hours  

\- Performance rating  



\## Project Type

\- Academic / Internship Project  

\- SQL / DBMS Project  

\- Database-focused project with \*\*no frontend or web application\*\*
